# Softuni_Courses
Here are my solutions to all the SoftUni courses I've attended :)

I started studying in Softuni about an year ago and I have almost completed the python pathway after finishing the boasic,fundamentals,advanced and database courses with 
almost perfect scores. I have also attended the SoftUniFest 2023.
